# 401PreworkCalculator


How to use:
Open the code in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, click the Start with the green arrow, and if it all works the user will be prompted for a First Number, a Second, then the operand. If all inputs are valid the user will get a result. 


How Long did it take me?
A little embarrassed to say this took me around 2-3 hours. Learning a new language has been a lot more daunting than I expected. C# is a very different beast from JavaScript...

struggles? why? how did you overcome?
The Microsoft Visual Studio for C# is surprisingly different from the Visual Studio Code I only recently got accustomed too.  In addition to that, starting new projects from scratch is pretty intimidating and my thoughts tend to spiral. I rewatched some of the tutorial videos, and then started writing out some framework code that I adjusted after looking up some stack overflows to clear up some of my many problems. 


what did I learn?
Console Apps are different than Form Apps (GUI from what I could tell). I also gained an apperciation for our complex calculators that come generic on smartphones. Simple features I would've wanted to get too if I had started sooner is to be able to continue calculations as well as make it more dynamic to include more than 2 numbers. 


what resources did I use?
A few youtube videos, stack overflows, the docs though I'm not that big of a fan of the C#/microsoft docs compared to mdn or jquery.
